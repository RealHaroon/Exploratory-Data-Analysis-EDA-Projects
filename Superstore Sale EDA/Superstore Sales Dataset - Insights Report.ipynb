    "## 🧾 **Phase 1 — Data Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you did:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loaded the Superstore dataset (9994 records, 21 fields). ([GitHub][1])\n",
    "* Converted date fields (`Order Date`, `Ship Date`) to datetime format. ([GitHub][1])\n",
    "* Verified data types and column structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The dataset contains comprehensive retail transaction data (sales, discount, profit, products, customers, etc.) covering multiple years. ([Hevo Data][2])\n",
    "* No missing values or duplicates were found — giving confidence in data quality.\n",

    "\n",
    "**What you did:**\n",

    "* Computed `Shipping_Days` for delivery performance.\n",
    "* Handled negative profit values where needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",

    "* **Technology** and **Office Supplies** consistently lead in revenue contributions, while **Furniture** shows lower profit margin.\n",
    "* Some products generate **high sales but low profit**, indicating price or cost inefficiencies.\n",
    "  (This mirrors common Superstore EDA findings where expensive furniture categories underperform profitwise.) ([Analytics Vidhya][3])\n",
    "* Certain regions and segments show different profitability patterns — important for strategic focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business takeaway:**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Impact of Discount on Profit\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visualized average profit vs discount.\n",
    "* A clear **negative relationship** emerges: higher discounts correspond with lower average profits.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Discounts are prevalent and moderate to high discounts are frequent**, which correlate with lower profit generation.\n",
    "2. **Technological and Office Supplies segments** outperform Furniture in profitability; Furniture needs pricing strategy review. ([Medium][4])\n",
    "3. Certain **high sales sub-categories** are unprofitable due to aggressive discounting — candidates for pricing re-calibration.\n",
    "4. **Top customers vary in profitability** — not all high-spending customers generate high profit.\n",
    "5. Seasonal sales trends suggest **marketing focus on peak periods** to maximize revenue.\n",
    "\n",
